Quantum Leap
============

The following source code was developed for a subject called Logic Programming (Programação em Lógica) of Informatics Engineering at FEUP. 
I made the decision to make this code available to all students to help them learn and improve their Prolog programming. 
For that reason, you're free to use the code on your own will. Hope it helps.

Overview
============

This project is based on the board game called Quantum Leap and was developed using Prolog.

The rules of the game are described on the file quantum_leap_rules.pdf.

Requirements
============

To execute the application you first need to have SICStus or SWI-Prolog installed in your computer.

Usage
============

After you have all the requirements, you must consult the file named project.pl.

To start the game you must call the startGame(size) predicate.

You must specify the size of the board at the beginning or, if not specified, the application will assume it has size 5.

Note: for those who never used Prolog, every "instruction" ends with '.' (ending point). 
So, if you want to start a game, you must do this (after consulting project.pl):

startGame(10).
